     * Question 1 : Apply Merge sort to sort an array of Strings. (Assume that all the characters 
     * in all the Strings are in lowercase). (EASY)
     * Sample Input 1 : arr = { "sun", "earth", "mars", "mercury" }
     * Sample Output 1 : arr = { "earth", "mars", "mercury", "sun"}
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Question 2 : Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. (MEDIUM)
     * The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume
     * that the majority element always exists in the array.
     * Sample Input 1 : nums = [3,2,3]
     * Sample Output 1 : 3
     * Sample Input 2 : nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
     * Sample Output 2 : 2
     * Constraints (extra Conditions):
     * ● n == nums.length
     * ● 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
     * ● -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Question 3 : Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array. (HARD)
     * Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is
     * from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. If an array 
     * is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum.
     * Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.
     * 
     * 
     * Sample Input 1 : N = 5, arr[ ] = {2, 4, 1, 3, 5}
     * Sample Output 1 : 3, because it has 3 inversions - (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
     * 
     * Sample Input 2 : N = 5, arr[ ] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
     * Sample Output 2 : 0, because the array is already sorted
     * 
     * Sample Input 3 : N = 3, arr[] = {5, 5, 5}
     * Sample Output 3 : 0, because all the elements of the array are the same & already in a
     * sorted manner.
     * 
     * 
     & (Hint : A sorting algorithm will be used to solve this question.)
     & Note - This question is important. Even if you are not able to come up with the approach,
     & please understand the solution.

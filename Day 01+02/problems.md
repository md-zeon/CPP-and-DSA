# Day 01+02: C++ Basics - Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Area of Square

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Description

Write a program to calculate the area of a square given the side length.

### Input Format

- A single integer `n` representing the side length of the square

### Output Format

- Print the area of the square in the format: "Area of a square is = [area]"

### Sample Input

```text
5
```

### Sample Output

```text
Area of a square is = 25
```

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

## Problem 2: Bill Calculator with GST

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Description

Calculate the total bill amount including GST (Goods and Services Tax) for purchased items.

### Input Format

- Three float values representing the prices of pencil, pen, and eraser respectively

### Output Format

- Print the total bill amount (including 18% GST) in the format: "Total Bill = [amount]"

### Sample Input

```
10 20 5
```

### Sample Output

```
Total Bill = 40.5
```

### Explanation

- Cost of items: 10 + 20 + 5 = 35
- GST (18%): 35 × 0.18 = 6.3
- Total: 35 + 6.3 = 41.3 (Note: Sample output shows 40.5, which might be a calculation error in original code)

### Constraints

- 0 ≤ price ≤ 10000 for each item

## Problem 3: Simple Interest Calculator

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Description

Calculate simple interest using the formula: (P × R × T) / 100

### Input Format

- Three values: principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and time period (T)

### Output Format

- Print the simple interest in the format: "Interest is = [interest]"

### Sample Input

```
1000 5 2
```

### Sample Output

```
Interest is = 100
```

### Explanation

- Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000000
- 1 ≤ R ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 30

## Problem 4: Area of Circle

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Description

Calculate the area of a circle given the radius using π = 3.14

### Input Format

- A single integer representing the radius

### Output Format

- Print the area in the format: "Area of circle is = [area]"

### Sample Input

```
7
```

### Sample Output

```
Area of circle is = 153.86
```

### Explanation

- Area = π × r² = 3.14 × 7 × 7 = 153.86

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ radius ≤ 1000

## Additional Practice Problems

### Problem 5: Temperature Conversion

Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Formula:** F = (C × 9/5) + 32

### Problem 6: Even or Odd

Check if a given number is even or odd.

### Problem 7: Largest of Three Numbers

Find the largest among three given numbers.

### Problem 8: Leap Year Check

Check if a given year is a leap year.

**Hint:** A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except when it is divisible by 400.

# 🔄 Dry Run: Object Oriented Programming - Part 1

## 📋 What is a Dry Run?

A dry run is the process of manually executing code step-by-step to understand:
- How the algorithm works
- What happens at each step
- How data changes over time
- Where bugs might occur

## 🎯 Purpose

Performing dry runs helps you:
- ✅ Understand algorithm flow
- ✅ Identify logical errors
- ✅ Verify correctness
- ✅ Build intuition

## 📝 Example Dry Runs

### Example 1: Basic Case

**Problem:** [Describe the problem]

**Input:**
```
Sample input data
```

**Execution Trace:**

| Step | Operation | Variables | Output | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Initialize | - | - | Starting state |
| 2 | Process | - | - | Main logic |
| 3 | Finalize | - | - | Final result |

**Output:**
```
Expected result
```

### Example 2: Edge Case

**Input:**
```
Edge case input
```

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Initial state: [description]
2. After iteration 1: [description]
3. After iteration 2: [description]
...
n. Final state: [description]

**Output:**
```
Result for edge case
```

## 🧪 Practice Dry Runs

### Exercise 1
Try dry running with input: `[example]`

**Template:**
```
Initial: 
Step 1:
Step 2:
...
Final:
```

### Exercise 2
Try with different input: `[example]`

## 💭 Common Mistakes

❌ **Mistake 1:** Skipping initialization
✅ **Fix:** Always note initial values

❌ **Mistake 2:** Not tracking all variables
✅ **Fix:** Create a variable table

❌ **Mistake 3:** Ignoring edge cases
✅ **Fix:** Test boundary conditions

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After practicing dry runs:
- [ ] Can trace code execution mentally
- [ ] Can predict output without running
- [ ] Can identify bugs by inspection
- [ ] Can explain algorithm to others
